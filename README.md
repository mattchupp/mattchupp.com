It’s not much, but it’s mine.

### How I Do It
Recently, I switched this whole thing up. I dumped GoDaddy
and went to digital ocean and it's been nice.
The website is just cloned from this git repo. When I want to
update it, I work locally - push my changes - and pull them in
my home directory for the website. Yay!
